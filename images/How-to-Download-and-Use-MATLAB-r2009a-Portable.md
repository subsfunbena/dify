MATLAB is a programming and numeric computing platform used by millions of engineers and scientists to analyze data, develop algorithms, and create models[^5^]. However, installing MATLAB on your computer can be a hassle, especially if you don't have a license or a compatible operating system. That's why some people prefer to use a portable version of MATLAB that can run from a USB drive or a cloud storage without any installation or activation.
